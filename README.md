# Golo Vim syntax

This bundle adds a basic syntax support for the [Golo programming language](http://golo-lang.org/).

It works best when used in combination with [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/jponge/vim-golo.git

## Status

The current form brings basic syntax highlighting in Vim, which is already better than monochrome text.

I am no Vim tuning expert, so feel-free to contribute improvements! **(pull requests only)**
